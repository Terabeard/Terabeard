# Hi there, I'm Terabeard! 👋

Greetings fellow tinkerers! I'm a developer and software architect with by now 16 years of professional experience. If I count in the years of tinkering personally I'm almost at 20 years into coding :). 

Here's a bit about me:

## 🚀 About Me
- 🔭 I’m currently working on my own blog which will be up pretty soon. This has been a personal favorite of mine for many years now. One of my good intentions for 2025 is actually starting one :).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Jekyll actually as that is what I'm using for the blog. Next to that I'm also tinkering with my homelab and Linux which I started at the end of 2024. Just some basis stuff with VM's, containers and CD/CI pipelines.
- 📫 How to reach me: For now, only by github
- ⚡ Fun fact: Yeah, you guessed it right, I have a beard!

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
- Programming Languages: Java, SQL, PLSQL, HTML, C#, C and C++ (very basics), Rust
